Hello there. This repo contains two notebooks: one for preprocessing step, one for model fitting. 

Preprocessing step involves:
  1) Importing and shuffling the raw dataset
  2) Removing bias towards one type of user, namely those who have not returned to the app after using it for a short amount of time
  3) Standardizing the non-biased dataset for a valid NN model fitting
  4) Splitting the data set into training, test and validation subsets.

Model fitting step involves simply setting up the model layers and then training it.
